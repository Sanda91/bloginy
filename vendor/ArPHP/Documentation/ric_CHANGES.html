What's new in ArPHP 2.5.1 (release date: Aug 19, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Refactoring ArAutoSummarize sub class, it is now 200% faster.

* Add check to the iconv output, if empty then use internal ArCharsetC converter.

* Add singleton pattern to the ArCharsetC sub class as an option, implementing 
  this pattern allows a programmer to make this single instance easily accessible 
  by many other objects. 

* Default charset loaded in the ArCharsetC sub class become only Windows-1256 
  and UTF-8 for more optimization.
  
* ArabicTest source code become compliant to the PEAR Coding Standards.

* You can pass CSS style name as fourth parameter in both highlightSummary and 
  highlightRateSummary methods in ArAutoSummary instead of background color for 
  more flexibility (see related example)

* Fix charset name for Windows-1256 in the iconv command (convert to CP1256) in 
  the core Arabic class, and append &quot;//TRANSLIT&quot; to the output charset.

* Fix warning message in ArAutoSummarize sub class (line 629) when $word is empty.

* Fix charset conversion of swap_ae method input in the ArKeySwap sub class. 


What's new in ArPHP 2.5 (release date: Aug 5, 2009)
-----------------------------------------------------

* Add ArStandarization sub class and &quot;standard&quot; method, this method will 
  standardize Arabic text to follow writing standards (just like magazine rules).
  
* Add simple and rough ArStemmer sub class and &quot;stem&quot; method, this method will 
  return Arabic stem for a given Arabic word (http://arabtechies.net/node/83). 
  Algorithm provides by Taha Zerrouki &lt;taha.zerrouki@gmail.com&gt;
  
* cleanCommon method in the ArAutoSummarize sub class become public now.

* Add loadExtra method to the ArAutoSummarize sub class to load an enhanced  
  Arabic stop words list.

* Apply semi-factory pattern by using PHP Reflection and Magic methods to reduce 
  Arabic.php core file size from 43 KB to 9 KB (allocated only 63% of memory 
  comparing to previouse version and 3% faster).
  
* You can load different sub class dynamically using load method, no need to 
  have new instance for this purpose any more.

* No need to access sub classes anymore, all methods available on the core 
  Arabic class level (still previous mode supported and compatible).
  
* Name of sub class you would like to load is required now when create an 
  instance from Arabic class, and mode 'All' is not supported any more.

* Fix using auto load Boolean switch inside Arabic class constructor by use 
  global $use_autoload (thanks to Mr. Taha Zerrouki to refer to this issue).

* Fix Arabic numbers bidi when followed by Arabic comma or Arabic question 
  mark in ArGlyphs sub class.

* ArPHP source code become compliant to the PEAR Coding Standards

* Check compatibility with PHP 6.0.0-dev, MySQL 6.0.4-alpha, and cloud computing.
